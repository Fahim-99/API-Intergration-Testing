# Project Title: Automate a demo fintech API by postman & newman
## Project Summary: In this project, I created a flow that enables administrators to log in, add new users, and perform a number of CRUD tasks for the users.  Among other things, users can send and receive money, deposit and withdraw money, make payments, and view their own balances and statements.  Agents can also transmit and deposit money to their clients.  The retailer is paid by the customer.  Additionally, confirm their balance and statement.
